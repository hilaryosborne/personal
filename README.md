# Portfolio ReactJS Project

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. This project is written entirely as a ReactJS single page application. I have released the code to hopefully show how a fully ReactJS website can be realised. This project is based off of my ReactJS SPA boilerplate repository. I know there are multiple ways to create a ReactJS project however I hope that this repository helps to demonstrate my particular take on how it's done.
