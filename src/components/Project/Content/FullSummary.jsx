            The requirements of the DTH Media project were to create a modern public facing sales website along with a sales portal aimed at providing an online ordering process for geo printed marketing campaigns. A number of different technologies were used such as WordPress, NodeJS + ReactJS, mongoDB and Google Maps API. The result was an intuitive web platform that allowed for distributions areas to be planned and displayed within google maps for complete user self service.
