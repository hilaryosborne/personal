    "about": "Look no further if you are after a creative developer who has a long history in the digital industry and is constantly pushing the boundaries with new tools and methodologies.\n\nI would best describe myself as an **ES6** and **PHP** developer with a wide range of skills and experience across multiple technical, creative and business skill-sets.  I believe in approaching each digital problem by using a number of various technologies according to their strengths, industry track record and appropriateness for the problem at hand. My frameworks of choice are generally **ReactJS** (ES6) and **Laravel** (PHP) however I do have experience across a number of different frameworks and platforms such as **Symfony**, **WordPress**, **ExpressJS** etc. While I actively work across a broad range of digital disciplines, I do currently have a special focus on exploring single page application development using **ReactJS** and **Laravel**.\n\nDevelopment may be my strength, but problem solving is my passion. To me, problem solving is not limited to development alone. Creative and UX is a discipline that I actively pursue and, I believe, it makes me a better developer to lead and contribute in these areas. I greatly respect creative experts and I strive to contribute, enable and learn from graphic and UX professionals with whom I have the privilege to work alongside with. I believe that by having experience working across creative and technical makes me a better developer with a greater capacity to provide workable digital solutions.\n\nFinally, there is more to what I can offer than what I can fit into this small introduction. I invite you to browse my portfolio, or chat with me directly, to better gauge my ability and experience in digital development, leadership, creative and mentorship. Working together, I am sure we can learn, implement, monitor and improve digital solutions to solve almost any problem."

I had found the, what I thought at the time, restrictive way that WordPress approaches templating to be inefficient and difficult to work with. Coming from a strong symphony background I was used to twig templates allowing me to customize the look of pages with relative ease. After finding out about Visual Composer I manipulated the plugin to become a complete drag and drop page builder. It was during this project that I began to see the limitations of this approach and realize that there was a lot more to developing WordPress themes. Aside from that I had a great deal of fun working on this project. The major constraint was time and the client had a need to have the site ready and launched within a two-week period. I worked with a junior developer to research what other sites in the industry provided users as well as built up a good understanding of what the general look and feel was. The design and development process was rapid and we had a release candidate up within a week. The client, who is a client we have worked with on multiple times before, was happy and with relatively little changes we proceeded to launch.",

      "description": "The Drug and Alcohol Institute project was the first project that pushed me into learning WordPress. Before this time, I had mainly worked with Drupal 7 and Symfony however the client required that the final proposal included WordPress. The integration requirements for this project were extensive and it was now that I decided to build the Visual Composer Form Framework to provide the necessary custom logic to the various forms on the website. My research of existing form plugins such as Gravity and Ninja forms resulted in the realization that they were just not set up for heavy forms with advanced conditional logic. The final project resulted in a heavily customised WordPress platform with custom plugin and theme development as well as integration with Axcelerate, Xero, eWay and Vision 6. The site is fully responsive and built entirely using the drag and drop site builder plugin Visual Composer.",

      "description": "When I first started at Axiom college during 2012 they had a custom solution in place with limited responsive and content management features. Over the following 6 months I embedded myself within the company and learned the processes and industry which Axiom College operated. Having come directly from a University background (Griffth) I was familiar with adult education but the VET industry was something completely new. I worked with the organisation’s sales and marketing manager to develop a new look within a Drupal 7 platform to replace the current limited system. The new Drupal 7 solution provided a far easier way for staff to add course material, better integration and better responsive features. Overall my goal was to develop something modern, scalable and flexible for the new marketing direction the company was heading. After two years of running the Drupal 7 system the requirements of the company had changed and they were looking for something easier and more straight forward for their staff to use for publishing and sales. It was decided that a move to a WordPress platform was the best choice as the administrative experience was more in line with the administration staff’s expectations. The current website was developed using Visual Composer with a custom theme and considerable plugin development to allow for direct integration with the company’s FileMaker database. The aim was to create a responsive and accessible platform that simplified the process for adding courses and content to the website. This was a considerable task given the complex amount of integration requirements which needed to be met in order for enrollments and course information to be communicated reliably and efficiently.",
