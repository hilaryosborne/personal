    "about": "Look no further if you are after a creative developer who has a long history in the digital industry and is constantly pushing the boundaries with new tools and methodologies.\n\nI would best describe myself as an **ES6** and **PHP** developer with a wide range of skills and experience across multiple technical, creative and business skill-sets.  I believe in approaching each digital problem by using a number of various technologies according to their strengths, industry track record and appropriateness for the problem at hand. My frameworks of choice are generally **ReactJS** (ES6) and **Laravel** (PHP) however I do have experience across a number of different frameworks and platforms such as **Symfony**, **WordPress**, **ExpressJS** etc. While I actively work across a broad range of digital disciplines, I do currently have a special focus on exploring single page application development using **ReactJS** and **Laravel**.\n\nDevelopment may be my strength, but problem solving is my passion. To me, problem solving is not limited to development alone. Creative and UX is a discipline that I actively pursue and, I believe, it makes me a better developer to lead and contribute in these areas. I greatly respect creative experts and I strive to contribute, enable and learn from graphic and UX professionals with whom I have the privilege to work alongside with. I believe that by having experience working across creative and technical makes me a better developer with a greater capacity to provide workable digital solutions.\n\nFinally, there is more to what I can offer than what I can fit into this small introduction. I invite you to browse my portfolio, or chat with me directly, to better gauge my ability and experience in digital development, leadership, creative and mentorship. Working together, I am sure we can learn, implement, monitor and improve digital solutions to solve almost any problem."
